# Fine-Tuning GPT-3 for Household-Related Queries

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-3 for answering household-related queries. The process involves:

1. **Transforming the input data** into a format suitable for fine-tuning.
2. **Training a fine-tuned model** using OpenAI's API with a specific dataset.
3. **Generating responses** for various questions related to household tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Python library (`openai`)
- A fine-tuning-enabled OpenAI account

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:
   pip install openai
